A Demo Contact Manager App built with AngularJS!!
=======

###Some of the things I used to build it


**AngularJS**

An awesome MVVM style javascript framework that is perfect for building Single Page Applications!

**Firebase / AngularFire**

* __Firebase__ is a Scalable real-time backend system that allows you to sync and persist your data in realtime*

* __AngularFire__ is Firebase bindings for AngularJS. Simply declare the Firebase module as a dependency for your app. Import whatever JSON you want to use into your firebase database and bind a Firebase URL to a model in your controller. Theres so much more that you can do with firebase and angulareFire and I highly recommend you check it out!*

**SCSS/Compass**

Why use regular ol' css when you can use SASS and get VARIABLES and MIXINS and so much more awesome stuff

**Grunt**

A task runner on the command line for running all kinds of tasks for you like compiling all of your scss files, linting, concatenating, and uglifying your js files, and SO MUCH MORE! Grunt is amazing. USE IT!!

**html5**

Write your markup more semantically and take advantage of some of the cool new features html5 offers.

**NodeJS**

Just the thought of writing javascript on the server is rad but using nodes package manager NPM is so handy sometimes..need something just NPM install that bad boy
