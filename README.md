A Demo Contact Manager App built with AngularJS!!
=======

###Some of the things I used to build it


**AngularJS**

*An awesome MVVM style javascript framework that is perfect for building Single Page Applications!*

**SCSS/Compass**

*Why use regular ol' css when you can use SASS and get VARIABLES and MIXINS and so much more awesome stuff*

**Grunt**

*A task runner on the command line for running all kinds of tasks for you like compiling all of your scss files, linting, concatenating, and uglifying your js files, and SO MUCH MORE! Grunt is amazing. USE IT!!*

**html5**

*Write your markup more semantically and take advantage of some of the cool new features html5 offers.*

**NodeJS**

*Just the thought of writing javascript on the server is rad but using nodes package manager NPM is so handy sometimes..need something just NPM install that bad boy*
